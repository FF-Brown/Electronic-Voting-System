# Electronic-Voting-System

CptS 322 : Haipeng Cai
Description: To build an electronic voting system that enables voters to vote
securely from remote sites. The system will be configurable allowing users to
specify candidates, total votes available, date range for voting, and the
winning number of votes reaching until the winning candidate can be determined
without waiting until all votes are casted.

The system should include a user interface showing the voting results and
possibly the vote statistics by geographic locations or political regions for
which visualizations can be employed to enhance the understanding of results.
